SpeedCrunch is a simple but powerful calculator.

Among its features are:
- high precision, up to 50 decimal digits
- to be enjoyed using keyboard
- result shown in scrollable window
- history of last expressions (use up and down arrow)
- built-in functions: abs, sqrt, pi, log, exp, ln, sin, cos, tan, sinh,
  cosh, tanh, asin, acos, atan, arsinh, arcosh, artanh
- postfix operator ! lets you compute factorials
- support for variables, e.g try x=pi/3 and then sin(x)
- special variable ans holds the last calculation result
- percent operator, try e.g. 45%*75 or price/80%
- angle mode: Alt+D for degrees, Alt+R for radians
- automatic parentheses closing, e.g. cos(pi/4 becomes cos(pi/4)


Using SpeedCrunch
------------------

SpeedCrunch is easy to use, just type the expression that you want to calculate
and press Enter. Result is shown in the scrollable display. And, you can quickly
copy the last calculation result to the clipboard using Ctrl+R.

If you want to reuse again the expression which you typed before, then press up
and down arrow to access the expression history.

Beside standard algebraic operators like + (addition), - (substraction),
* (multiplication), * (division), ^ or ** (power), there is support for some
functions, for example sin, log, abs, and many more. You do not need to memorize
function names, use Ctrl+F to pop up a dialog where you can choose the function
that you need. Or take advantage of auto-completion feature, for example type s
only and in less than a second you will be automagically given with choices of
sin, sinh, and sqrt.

Advanced calculation sometimes needs memory feature. SpeedCrunch allows a
variable to hold calculation result. Using assignment, such as x=0.3 means that
variable named x has the value of 0.3, which you can always later on, for
example sin(x). You can define as many variables as you want. When you want to
use a variable but you can not recall its exact name, use Ctrl+I to show a list
of variables that you can pick easily.

There is a special variable, ans, which always holds the last calculation
result. Another variable pi holds one of the most important constant in
math world.

Your expression history (maximum last 100 expressions), as well as variables
you have defined, are saved between sessions. This means, you can still recall
those calculations you have done yesterday or last week.

Often, SpeedCrunch can still understand an incomplete expression. For example,
just typing sin followed by Enter - likely means taking the sine of last value
- is automatically translated as sin(ans). Also, for such function you may skip
the parentheses if you pass simple number or variable, sin 0.1 is as valid as
sin(0.1). Speaking about parentheses, closing them can be left to SpeedCrunch,
e.g. cos(pi/4 is automatically corrected to cos(pi/4).

Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------
Up/Down   recall last expression
Ctrl+I    insert variable
Ctrl+F    insert function
Ctrl+R    copy last result to clipboard
Ctrl+S    save current session to text file
Alt+D     degrees mode for trigonometric functions
Alt+R     radians mode for trigonometric functions


Installation
------------

Download is available from http://www.speedcrunch.org, the official website.

If you are installing SpeedCrunch from a disk image on an Apple Mac, all you
need do is drag the SpeedCrunch application icon to your Applications folder.
The application, and Qt itself, is in the bundle represented by the icon.

You need Qt (from Trolltech) at least version 4.2 to be able to compile
SpeedCrunch. Most Linux distributions normally already package the latest
version of Qt, so it is likely that you need to worry about this. However,
you need the development package as well (sometimes named as qt-devel or
qt4-devel, it depends on the distribution).

You also need CMake (from Kitware) at least version 2.4.4. CMake is available
for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

To compile, simply extract the source tarball. Then create a build directory
(where the program will be compiled and linked). From the build directory,
first run:
  cmake <path to source directory>\src

and then:
  make

Note: the build directory should not be the same as the source directory.
