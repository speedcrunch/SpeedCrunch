SpeedCrunch post-0.9
---------------------
New features:
  preliminary support of logic functions
  extended output of real-valued numbers to non-decimal modes
  arithmetic integer divide and modulo

Improvements and bug fixes:
  Fixed loss of precision on variable saving
  Fixed clobbering of ans on radix change

SpeedCrunch 0.9
---------------------
New features:
  greatly extended number range
  factorials extended to real values
  stay always-on-top (#106)

New functions:
  ARSINH: area hyperbolic sine, the reverse of sinh
  ARCOSH: area hyperbolic cosine, the reverse of cosh
  ARTANH: area hyperbolic tangent, the reverse of tanh

Improvements and bug fixes:
  replaced the math engine,
    solving issue #53, #78, #98,
    preparing a solution for issue #16, #62, #90,
    better support for issue #47
    uniform and predictable accuracy
    correct rounding (2.5 is rounded to 2 [even last digit rule])
    stable algorithms covering the whole range of numbers
    faster evaluation of higher mathematical function (factor 9 on the average)
    supports stable evaluation of basic higher functions near poles and zeros
    built-in support of conversion of all (integer, real, huge, tiny) values to other bases
    built-in support of logic operations
    built-in support of the missing area hyperbolic functions

  extended TRUNC to the new range of exponents. In addition, TRUNC accepts a negative
    second parameter now: TRUNC(1234.56; -2) is 1200, so not only digits from the
    fractional part can be cleared, but also the least significant digits from the
    integer part.
  extended ROUND in a way similiar to TRUNC
